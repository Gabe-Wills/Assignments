P1 and M1-The Components Required to Serve and View a Web Page and Explain the Role of Web Archutecture in Website Communication

* **Components:**

There are multiple components required to view a web page. One of these is a router. A router is a piece of hardware which connects multiple computer networks via wired or wireless connections (Mitchell, 2017). This is required to view a website because a stable network connection is needed to load the various content on the webpage. Another component needed to view a webpage is a proxy server. A proxy server is a computer which acts as a gateway between a local network, such as all the computers on a single network in a school, and a larger network like the internet. The use of a proxy server provides increased performance, security and in some cases a higher level of employee monitoring (Indiana University, 2017). The above are both hardware components which allow the user to view a web page. But to a web page also requires the use of a browser of some kind e.g. Google Chrome. The use of a browser allows the user to quickly and easily browse a list of webpages linked to the keywords in the users search. The use of all of the above components allows the user to either serve a webpage (through a proxy server) or view a webpage.
