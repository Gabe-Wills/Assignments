**Introduction**
 
 This report is going to outline and explain what components are required to view or deliver a webpage and how web architecture allows websites to communicate between each other. Also I will be explaining the role of TCP/IP and how it links to application layer protocols.

**P1 and M1-The Components Required to Serve and View a Web Page and Explain the Role of Web Archutecture in Website Communication**

* **Components:**

There are multiple components required to view a web page. One of these is a router. A router is a piece of hardware which connects multiple computer networks via wired or wireless connections (Mitchell, 2017). This is required to view a website because a stable network connection is needed to load the various content on the webpage. Another component needed to view a webpage is a proxy server. A proxy server is a computer which acts as a gateway between a local network, such as all the computers on a single network in a school, and a larger network like the internet. The use of a proxy server provides increased performance, security and in some cases a higher level of employee monitoring (Indiana University, 2017). The above are both hardware components which allow the user to view a web page. But to a web page also requires the use of a browser of some kind e.g. Google Chrome. The use of a browser allows the user to quickly and easily browse a list of webpages linked to the keywords in the users search. The use of all of the above components allows the user to either serve a webpage (through a proxy server) or view a webpage.

* **Web Architecture**

To use the internet and allow the user to easily jump between different websites, web architecture allows for this to happen by communicating between different websites. This process requires a number of things. Firstly, the user needs to have an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP gives the user access to the internet by providing home, mobile or satellite broadband (n/a, 2013).  This is required for websites to communicate information because if the information has been inputted by the user in one place but the information needs to be entered somewhere else as well, the user isnt going to want to retype everything they have already written, this means that the user needs a broadband connection to save their details online and make website able to auto fill out information it already knows e.g. Chrome Autofill settings. Another piece of architecture which websites require to communicate is the use of domain names. Domain names and structures are important for all websites. There are two types of domains Top Level Domains(TLDs) and Sub Level domains (SLDs). A TLD is the main website (.com, .org etc) where the user starts when they go on the home page of a website. A SLD is a sub-division of the main page, this takes the user to a separate part of the website but is still connected to the TLD. The use of SLD's allows the website to operate off one domain but still take the user to multiple pages (n/a, What is domain structure?, 2017). This aids website communication because it allows the main website (TLD) to communicate user choices of what page to go to next to the SLD. Finally, every website requires the use of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web allows website communication because every website is hosted on the World Wide Web, meaning that each website has the capability to communicate information between each other as they are all based on the same service.
